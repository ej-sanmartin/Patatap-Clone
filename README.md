Patatap-Clone 12/12/2017
=======================

Description
-----------------------

Make music and random circle animations appear with a click of your keyboard!!

Original patatap is "http://patatap.com/" and is incredibly fun app to toy around with!

This proects creates circle animations randomly on the page, with the help of HTML5 Canvas, and is followed by random sounds, provided by the sounds folder of this project. To use this project, press any of the keys with a letter on it. Does not work with the numbers, space, or any other keys. However, with the letter keys you can still have tons of fun!

This project further helped me gain a solid understanding of the front end side of developing web apps and, also, gave me the experience of working with jQuery selectors and events. Also, this project allowed me to work with libraries (Paper.js and Howler.js) and the worlflow (experimenting, looking through the docs, etc) involved with working with other people's codes.
